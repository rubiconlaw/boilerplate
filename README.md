# Boilerplate
Boilerplate is that language usually found at the end of a contract sometimes under a "Miscellaneous" heading. This language is often overlooked or ignored, sometimes with negative consequences. This page contains model provisions for each of the most common types of boilerplate language. These model provisions comply with Ken Adam's Manual of Style for Contract Drafting.
